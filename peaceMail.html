							<p>PeaceMail is a Gmail plugin that helps you protect yourself from sending potentially regrettable emails.  People sometimes send emails that they later regret sending because the email was rude or harsh. These regretful emails are often sent in a hasty, reactionary way after receiving some other piece of news/information. We used few principles of Applied Behavioral Economics to design the Gmail Plugin that can influence sender’s behavior on detection of a potentially regrettable email. </p>

								<p>We conducted several qualitative interviews to find whether is this a real problem. Following are some of the quotes taken straight from the interviewees:

		“I felt that I was getting the short end of the stick and said stuff to a friend which I wish I hadn’t. I wouldn’t have sent that mail the next morning. Frankly, I wish I had just spoken to him in person.” 

		“One time, I sent a mail to my manager to vent my frustration on things being unfair. Next day, I felt so foolish about myself. ” 

		“I would often write the email out, in a moment of frustration, but from experience not trust myself to send it. Usually (I would) check it the next day and it would not be something I should send out.”

          <p>First, a user can tag previously sent emails as regrettable. The user can even highlight the specific words or phrases that were regrettable. Second, the recipients of a user’s email can anonymously add reactions, similar to those in Slack. These reactions can also be tied to specific words or phrases of the email.
Third, our algorithms will combine the user’s and recipients’ input with other factors, like time of day and formatting, to come up with a model of what makes up a potentially regrettable email for that user. Our plugin then dynamically analyzes future emails.</p>

<p>It highlights portions of email that might be potentially regrettable.
The user can choose to edit the email so it does not contain risky content.
We encourage the user to wait and ‘cool down’ for a bit before sending the email.
We even suggest activities to help users relax their minds.</p>

<p>Finally, if the user absolutely must send the email as-is, they will have to go through additional confirmation screens in order to send it.</p>
