							<p>Fly Fleet, LLC hosted a design competition for university-level human factors, user experience & design students! The design challenge was to socialize the travel experience that is to increase social interactions across users at the airport in a way that benefits travelers. Interactions might vary from relationship building across users, users and businesses.</p>
              <p>We participated in this competition and worked on this challenge for 3 months from September to November, 2016. We finally submitted our design by applying various user research and design techniques that we learnt in the User Interface Design and Development course. <b>In January 2017, we were announced the winner of this challenge!!</b></p>

								<p>In order to gain a deeper understanding of the needs and desires of travelers, we released 
a survey with the following questions:<br/>
Which of the following best describes how you feel about interacting with other people while traveling by air?<br/>
What types of social interactions with other travelers, if any, are most attractive to you?<br/>
What, if anything, might serve to increase your social interactions at airports?<br/>
	We recieved 800 responses to our  survey, with a fairly even distribution between gender, age and location. Around half of the survey population were open to talking to other people at the the airport, and around a fourth of them enjoyed talking to others at the airport. People listed that the social interactions they were interested in were chatting with others socially, meeting locals, professional networking, and carpooling. Interestingly, a fair amount of users noted that if they knew that there were other people with common interests at the airport, they would increase their effort in social interaction. Another common factor in motivation for interaction was the presence of food or bars. </p>
								<p>This was followed by deep-dive interviews of few frequent travellers. From our surveys and interviews, we got really varied insights and after a lot of brainstroming and discussions we were able to flesh out 3 personas; we decided to build our design considering these 3 personas in mind.</p>
