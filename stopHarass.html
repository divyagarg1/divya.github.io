							<p>The anonymity of social media provides a convenient façade to online harassment. This is especially seen in communities or social media platforms that are driven by user generated content. Current methods of handling such content, especially comments is either through an architectural design on the platform such as blocking or flagging or the use of moderators to sift through content. In this project, we explore using an algorithmic approach to support moderation by humans. This is done by mining for insults in social media, so that the comments that are identified as insults, can be automatically flagged for review and prioritized, thereby ensuring quicker action by moderators.</p>

								<p>We did some reasearch and literature review on the current trend  and the current solutions for preventing online harassment. A 2014 study by Pew research center showed that 40% of internet users have personally experienced online harassment, from the mild to the severe; 73% have witnessed it occur to others.</p>
								Current options of dealing with trolls online are threefold. One, using architectural elements such as blocking the user or flagging the comment that is prevalent on many social platforms. Two, by using Moderation, such as by using algorithms to identify vandals on Wikipedia.  Three, using the social conventions on the social platforms to encourage or discourage users. </p>          
                <p>All the above solutions are reactive in nature and the damage is already done to the victim. Our approach is to prevent harassment in the first place by detecting insults when a user is posting or commenting and providing them a warning notification that might change the mind of the user. If the user continued to post insulting comments, it would still be flagged for review and prioritized, thereby ensuring quicker action by moderators.</p>

          <p>First, a user can tag previously sent emails as regrettable. The user can even highlight the specific words or phrases that were regrettable. Second, the recipients of a user’s email can anonymously add reactions, similar to those in Slack. These reactions can also be tied to specific words or phrases of the email.
Third, our algorithms will combine the user’s and recipients’ input with other factors, like time of day and formatting, to come up with a model of what makes up a potentially regrettable email for that user. Our plugin then dynamically analyzes future emails.</p>

<p>It highlights portions of email that might be potentially regrettable.
The user can choose to edit the email so it does not contain risky content.
We encourage the user to wait and ‘cool down’ for a bit before sending the email.
We even suggest activities to help users relax their minds.</p>

<p>Finally, if the user absolutely must send the email as-is, they will have to go through additional confirmation screens in order to send it.</p>
